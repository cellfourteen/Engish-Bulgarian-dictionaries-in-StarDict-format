**Additional information and links**

Be aware that BGOffice is a long-standing project, currently alive and well, that may or may not be based on a previous work before the computerization and the Internet. Since their inception, the dictionaries of BGOffice have been edited, optimized, and supplemented with new entries and expanded definitions. This conversion into the StarDict's format is based on BGOffice and I claim no authorship over it. If you intend to use the dictionaries in a commercial manner, consult with your legal advisor to be absolutely sure that, in your case, the Creative Commons Zero license used here could be successfully upheld against copyright claims. The Creative Commons Zero license used here should be perceived solely as my intent to provide back the dictionaries in this format for the benefit of other people and for the benefit of the further refinements the dictionaries might receive in this way.

To edit yourself and compile the .tab files, and (optionally) compress the .dict files of the dictionaries, you need a text editor, Stardict-editor, and Dictzip. Check out the following helful links below.
